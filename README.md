# household-spending-dashboard
I am building a spending dashboard to monitor household expenses. I track daily spending in the MoneyLover app and export the data as CSV. One script cleans the raw data and assigns custom categories, while the other generates visualizations. To create an interactive dashboard like Tableau, I am using Dash Plotly.
